## Basic Meetups app to try out Next.js
This is a basic [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project meant for me to try out the framework.

It's an app that pulls data from a MongoDB database to display and add to a list of meetups. 

Some of the things I tried out in this project are:
- server-side pre-rendering of pages
- file-based routing, and nested pages/paths
- dynamic pages route data
- programmatic navigation and linking between pages
- data fetching for page generation with `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`
- api routes to handle form submission
- deploying `next.js` projects with Vercel

If you want to see how things work locally:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
